My portfolio created with svelte, GSAP and threlte.

This is supposed to be a learning project into threlte + gsap, I'll be creating another portfolio with actually a good design xD

# TODO: 
1. make three.js scenes reponsive :D I might even create a utility component for threlte and contribute if its useful enough.
